Journal Prompt: In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
Response: I started learning Python on Code Combat a few days ago. Code Combat was a fun and interesting introduction to the language and now I know how to do "While True Loops". After finishing all the levels on Code Combat, I was introduced to EarSketch which will teach how to code using Python to create music. I haven't been able to explore EarSketch quite yet but I'm sure I'll be able to learn more. From my experience, the most challenging thing about Python is making sure I include all of my punctuation marks and format my code properly. The final level on Code Combat was challenging because I struggled with using conditional statements properly.
