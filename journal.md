Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Journal Prompt: In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
Response: I started learning Python on Code Combat a few days ago. Code Combat was a fun and interesting introduction to the language and now I know how to do "While True Loops". After finishing all the levels on Code Combat, I was introduced to EarSketch which will teach how to code using Python to create music. I haven't been able to explore EarSketch quite yet but I'm sure I'll be able to learn more. From my experience, the most challenging thing about Python is making sure I include all of my punctuation marks and format my code properly. The final level on Code Combat was challenging because I struggled with using conditional statements properly.

Journal Prompt: In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?
Response: It is important to follow instructions exactly how they are given when learning to code so that you don't add any extra code or get the wrong result. When I was writing code for an assignment in Project STEM, it took forever to finish and then it took even longer to debug. Following instructions and syntax when coding is important so that your code can actually run properly and you don't have to analyze each line of code to figure out what went wrong. Also, paying attention to how certain functions are structured can prevent you from having to try to code differently to fix the syntax error.

Journal Prompt: Think about your daily routine and activities. Identify one task or process where computer science plays a role, either directly or indirectly. Write a paragraph describing how computer science is used and how it impacts your life. Consider things like apps you use, websites you visit, or even the technology behind devices you rely on. How would your day be different without this use of computer science?
Response: Computer science is used in the chromebooks we use for school. Computer science helps chromebooks carry out different actions when you press a key on the keyboard or tap on a tab to switch to it. Computer science is used for security in district owned chromebooks by restricting searches based on what keywords were used or restricting sites that could steal personal information. If we didn't use chromebooks at school, many of our assignments would have to be done on paper which would put a burden on the environment and keep us from getting work done for different classes easily. If I didn't have a chromebook, I wouldn't have to worry about charging it or making sure I have enough space in my backpack to put it in.
