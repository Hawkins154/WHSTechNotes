Journal Prompt: In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
Response: I started learning Python on Code Combat a few days ago. Code Combat was a fun and interesting introduction to the language and now I know how to do "While True Loops". After finishing all the levels on Code Combat, I was introduced to EarSketch which will teach how to code using Python to create music. I haven't been able to explore EarSketch quite yet but I'm sure I'll be able to learn more. From my experience, the most challenging thing about Python is making sure I include all of my punctuation marks and format my code properly. The final level on Code Combat was challenging because I struggled with using conditional statements properly.

Journal Prompt: In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?
Response: It is important to follow instructions exactly how they are given when learning to code so that you don't add any extra code or get the wrong result. When I was writing code for an assignment in Project STEM, it took forever to finish and then it took even longer to debug. Following instructions and syntax when coding is important so that your code can actually run properly and you don't have to analyze each line of code to figure out what went wrong. Also, paying attention to how certain functions are structured can prevent you from having to try to code differently to fix the syntax error.

Journal Prompt: Think about your daily routine and activities. Identify one task or process where computer science plays a role, either directly or indirectly. Write a paragraph describing how computer science is used and how it impacts your life. Consider things like apps you use, websites you visit, or even the technology behind devices you rely on. How would your day be different without this use of computer science?
Response: Computer science is used in the chromebooks we use for school. Computer science helps chromebooks carry out different actions when you press a key on the keyboard or tap on a tab to switch to it. Computer science is used for security in district owned chromebooks by restricting searches based on what keywords were used or restricting sites that could steal personal information. If we didn't use chromebooks at school, many of our assignments would have to be done on paper which would put a burden on the environment and keep us from getting work done for different classes easily. If I didn't have a chromebook, I wouldn't have to worry about charging it or making sure I have enough space in my backpack to put it in.

Journal Prompt: Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:
How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
How might understanding code help you in industries that aren’t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?
Response: Coding can be useful even if you have a job that doesn't require it. First, coding can help improve problem-solving skills by teaching you how to make programs that do the same thing in different ways and by forcing you to pay more attention to small details through debugging exercises. Understanding code can help in industries unrelated to technology by giving you the ability to simplify tedious processes using code or fix code that isn't working properly. Hospitals have to send bills to all of their patients and it's very time-consuming to have someone work on billing for each patient. Hospitals use automated systems to send these bills automatically so they can spend more time and money on giving care. Coding can also enhance creativity and collaboration by making it easier for multiple people to work on the same thing and do it in different ways. It is possible to create programs that use different methods to achieve the same result and there are a lot of sites that allow multiple people to write code on the same document. This enhances creativity by allowing people to do things in their way together.

Journal Prompt: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries like healthcare, education, and business, but it also comes with challenges. In this journal entry, write about how AI has the potential to help improve our lives. Then, consider some ways in which AI could cause harm, especially in areas like privacy, jobs, and security. Be sure to support your thoughts with examples for both sides.
Response:   AI helps improve efficiency in transportation by making it so that we need fewer bus, taxi, and delivery drivers. There is already a shortage of drivers so AI could help fill those spots. Also, many accidents are caused due to human misunderstandings and a lack of focus. It is unlikely that accidents would occur for the same reasons if AI was operating vehicles. Of course, AI can still make mistakes which is why it would take a lot of fine-tuning to rely on it completely. In short, many accidents in transportation could be prevented if people and AI worked together to operate rather than relying entirely on either party.
  AI can cause harm if it is relied on completely for recognition programs because many things, especially living beings, come in different shapes and sizes. It is very difficult to program a machine to classify certain images as the same item if they have many different characteristics. In the linked videos, the AI could only recognize faces with certain features, but it could not detect a face because the characteristics were slightly different. It would take much more work to teach AI to recognize something as a face when they can look so many different ways. Additionally, people have already used AI to alter their appearance online which can make it much easier to catfish others online. In short, AI struggles with recognizing the faces of many different people and it can be used to make the internet even unsafe than it is.

Journal Prompt: With the upcoming election, technology plays a huge role in various aspects, from voting machines to social media. How do you think computer science and technology impact the election process? Discuss one positive impact and one potential challenge or concern. Be sure to provide specific examples of how programming, security, or technology influences elections today.
Response: Technology impacts the election process in the form of digital voting machines. Digital voting machines are used to count votes without human intervention which reduces the risk of ballot counters being attacked during the election. Unfortunately, a potential challenge of using digital voting machines is if the machine malfunctions and miscounts the votes. Each vote counts during an election so if the count was messed up, the election could be seriously affected.

Journal Prompt: In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.
Response: It is important to protect your personal and sensitive information when posting online so that random people can't steal your information and impersonate you online. People can do many bad things with someone else's identity so they don't have to deal with the consequences. Protecting your information could prevent this from happening. A step you can take to ensure that the information you are sharing on social platforms is secure is using a strong password. I've never shared something personal online because I don't have many social media platforms and I've never been one to participate in them much either. You can balance collaboration and security by making sure you interact with trustworthy people and never overshare.

Journal Prompt: Choose a current event that interests you or impacts your community. In a paragraph, briefly summarize the event and explain how it relates to any of the concepts we’ve been learning in class (e.g., problem-solving, technology, or data analysis).
In a second paragraph, reflect on how advancements in computer science or technology could play a role in addressing this event or similar issues in the future.
Response: A current event that interests me is climate change.
  Climate change relates to problem-solving because it will take a lot of effort to get the world to work together to stop it. Also, the main cause of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases are released when we use fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. If we decide to use less fossil fuels, we'll have to find another way to support our current lifestyles.
  Advancements in computer science and technology can address climate change by compiling the emission rates of the whole world. This allows us to work together to reduce the rates in areas that release the most greenhouse gases. This could work with future global issues as well.
