Journal Prompt: In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
Response: I started learning Python on Code Combat a few days ago. Code Combat was a fun and interesting introduction to the language and now I know how to do "While True Loops". After finishing all the levels on Code Combat, I was introduced to EarSketch which will teach how to code using Python to create music. I haven't been able to explore EarSketch quite yet but I'm sure I'll be able to learn more. From my experience, the most challenging thing about Python is making sure I include all of my punctuation marks and format my code properly. The final level on Code Combat was challenging because I struggled with using conditional statements properly.

Journal Prompt: In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?
Response: It is important to follow instructions exactly how they are given when learning to code so that you don't add any extra code or get the wrong result. When I was writing code for an assignment in Project STEM, it took forever to finish and then it took even longer to debug. Following instructions and syntax when coding is important so that your code can actually run properly and you don't have to analyze each line of code to figure out what went wrong. Also, paying attention to how certain functions are structured can prevent you from having to try to code differently to fix the syntax error.

Journal Prompt: Think about your daily routine and activities. Identify one task or process where computer science plays a role, either directly or indirectly. Write a paragraph describing how computer science is used and how it impacts your life. Consider things like apps you use, websites you visit, or even the technology behind devices you rely on. How would your day be different without this use of computer science?
Response: Computer science is used in the chromebooks we use for school. Computer science helps chromebooks carry out different actions when you press a key on the keyboard or tap on a tab to switch to it. Computer science is used for security in district owned chromebooks by restricting searches based on what keywords were used or restricting sites that could steal personal information. If we didn't use chromebooks at school, many of our assignments would have to be done on paper which would put a burden on the environment and keep us from getting work done for different classes easily. If I didn't have a chromebook, I wouldn't have to worry about charging it or making sure I have enough space in my backpack to put it in.

Journal Prompt: Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:
How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
How might understanding code help you in industries that aren’t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?
Response: Coding can be useful even if you have a job that doesn't require it. First, coding can help improve problem-solving skills by teaching you how to make programs that do the same thing in different ways and by forcing you to pay more attention to small details through debugging exercises. Understanding code can help in industries unrelated to technology by giving you the ability to simplify tedious processes using code or fix code that isn't working properly. Hospitals have to send bills to all of their patients and it's very time-consuming to have someone work on billing for each patient. Hospitals use automated systems to send these bills automatically so they can spend more time and money on giving care. Coding can also enhance creativity and collaboration by making it easier for multiple people to work on the same thing and do it in different ways. It is possible to create programs that use different methods to achieve the same result and there are a lot of sites that allow multiple people to write code on the same document. This enhances creativity by allowing people to do things in their way together.

Journal Prompt: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries like healthcare, education, and business, but it also comes with challenges. In this journal entry, write about how AI has the potential to help improve our lives. Then, consider some ways in which AI could cause harm, especially in areas like privacy, jobs, and security. Be sure to support your thoughts with examples for both sides.
Response:   AI helps improve efficiency in transportation by making it so that we need fewer bus, taxi, and delivery drivers. There is already a shortage of drivers so AI could help fill those spots. Also, many accidents are caused due to human misunderstandings and a lack of focus. It is unlikely that accidents would occur for the same reasons if AI was operating vehicles. Of course, AI can still make mistakes which is why it would take a lot of fine-tuning to rely on it completely. In short, many accidents in transportation could be prevented if people and AI worked together to operate rather than relying entirely on either party.
  AI can cause harm if it is relied on completely for recognition programs because many things, especially living beings, come in different shapes and sizes. It is very difficult to program a machine to classify certain images as the same item if they have many different characteristics. In the linked videos, the AI could only recognize faces with certain features, but it could not detect a face because the characteristics were slightly different. It would take much more work to teach AI to recognize something as a face when they can look so many different ways. Additionally, people have already used AI to alter their appearance online which can make it much easier to catfish others online. In short, AI struggles with recognizing the faces of many different people and it can be used to make the internet even unsafe than it is.

Journal Prompt: With the upcoming election, technology plays a huge role in various aspects, from voting machines to social media. How do you think computer science and technology impact the election process? Discuss one positive impact and one potential challenge or concern. Be sure to provide specific examples of how programming, security, or technology influences elections today.
Response: Technology impacts the election process in the form of digital voting machines. Digital voting machines are used to count votes without human intervention which reduces the risk of ballot counters being attacked during the election. Unfortunately, a potential challenge of using digital voting machines is if the machine malfunctions and miscounts the votes. Each vote counts during an election so if the count was messed up, the election could be seriously affected.

Journal Prompt: In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.
Response: It is important to protect your personal and sensitive information when posting online so that random people can't steal your information and impersonate you online. People can do many bad things with someone else's identity so they don't have to deal with the consequences. Protecting your information could prevent this from happening. A step you can take to ensure that the information you are sharing on social platforms is secure is using a strong password. I've never shared something personal online because I don't have many social media platforms and I've never been one to participate in them much either. You can balance collaboration and security by making sure you interact with trustworthy people and never overshare.

Journal Prompt: Choose a current event that interests you or impacts your community. In a paragraph, briefly summarize the event and explain how it relates to any of the concepts we’ve been learning in class (e.g., problem-solving, technology, or data analysis).
In a second paragraph, reflect on how advancements in computer science or technology could play a role in addressing this event or similar issues in the future.
Response: A current event that interests me is climate change.
  Climate change relates to problem-solving because it will take a lot of effort to get the world to work together to stop it. Also, the main cause of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases are released when we use fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. If we decide to use less fossil fuels, we'll have to find another way to support our current lifestyles.
  Advancements in computer science and technology can address climate change by compiling the emission rates of the whole world. This allows us to work together to reduce the rates in areas that release the most greenhouse gases. This could work with future global issues as well.

Journal Prompt:  Reflect on how technology has changed the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food. In what ways does technology make food more affordable and accessible during the holiday season? Are there any negative effects of relying on technology for our food supply? Write a paragraph explaining your thoughts with examples.
Response: Technology has changed the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food by improving the efficiency and sustainability of food production. For example, the usage of vertical farming maximizes space while reducing water usage. Advancements in technology have also led to the creation of lab-grown meat that reduces the environmental impact on food consumption. Technology has impacted food distribution and purchase with food delivery apps. People can use apps to pay for food that a driver will deliver to their location. This is a way technology makes food more accessible during the holiday season, especially in areas that get a lot of snow. The negative impacts of relying on technology for food supply are fewer job availabilities in that field and technology's tendency to malfunction or fail under conditions it wasn't created to handle. For example, a delivery drone might have a harder time doing its job when it's raining or snowing outside.

Journal Prompt: Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to shape the way we live and work. This week, research one recent development in AI or another emerging technology (e.g., quantum computing, renewable energy tech, AR/VR, etc.). Summarize what you learned and share your thoughts on how it could impact society, your future career, or daily life.
Response: Recently, more advancements have been made concerning self-driving cars. I learned that the best way to teach AI how to drive safely is by allowing it to gain experience firsthand in a process called Reinforcement Learning. The integration of self-driving cars could impact society by lessening the need for taxi/uber drivers. Additionally, if the AI fails to drive safely, many people could be at risk. The potential for uncontrollable accidents concerns me, but I'm also excited that those who are stressed out when driving can travel safely and confidently. An ethical consideration that might need to be addressed as this technology evolves is whether or not driving should be left up completely to AI.

Response: From my perspective, the term "brain rot" refers to a collection of words with a pointless or stupid meaning. I feel like digital media has had an equally positive and negative impact on my mental health because it provides me with a stress outlet but also pushes negative concepts. I've never heard of "slop" until now but "lore" connected to my experience with technology because I was able to find the "lore" or backstory on different subjects through the internet. It is possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding brain rot by filtering the content you watch and processing your emotions properly through journaling or meditation.
# December 16, 2024
Journal Prompt: Are you looking forward to the winter break?
Response: I am looking forward to winter break so that I can relax. I also shouldn't have any work to do.
# January 8, 2025
Response: I enjoyed learning how to use new commands in ProjectStem. I think this class would be better if the curriculum were enforced more. A lot of us don't get work done because there isn't much keeping us from doing nothing the entire period.
For this semester, I'd like to learn how to use coding languages to create useful programs. Right now, learning some basic Java would be helpful so I could perform better in Computer Science UIL.
I am interested in pursuing certifications in this course so that I have career options once I graduate. I don't know what certifications I need to get a job in computer science, but I'm aiming for a Python certification right now. I would need a focused curriculum to do so.
# January 13, 2025
Response: I think the shift to using AI is great for companies looking to save money. Unfortunately, this means that there will be fewer job openings for entry-level and mid-level positions in software development and information technology support. I think AI can enhance job opportunities for younger, less experienced workers while limiting them for seasoned professionals. I would prepare myself for a career in a fluctuating market like that by staying on top of new technological advancements and learning how to integrate them into my repertoire of skills so they don't become obsolete.
# January 22, 2025
Response: Government intervention affects tech companies and their users by controlling whether or not the apps function globally. For example, TikTok is an app used all over the world but the US banned it and made it unavailable to the users in America. This also affects the income of the tech company and the feelings of society. As a result of the US TikTok ban, many TikTok users in America were upset and started moving onto other platforms(YouTube and Instagram) to use their short-form content(YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels) for entertainment. I think TikTok could make the world aware of what it does, will continue to do, and improve on to protect privacy. This relates to data privacy because having sensitive data leaked is a very dangerous situation that can lead to others impersonating you and utilizing your resources(money and influence) for their goals.
If I was a developer at TikTok, I would make sure that the user has a way to be aware of exactly what the app is doing to calibrate its algorithm to their tastes. That way, it's no shock when users hear about social media app data collection. A lesson I can take from this situation when developing my own projects is to not let the way my projects functions operate cross any boundaries regardless of how much easier it would be to ignore it.

Response: We can attempt to prevent accidents like this from happening by making improvements in human-computer interaction and air traffic control systems. A common issue these days is an overreliance on technology and an air traffic controller shortage. If we trust technology too much and ignore its flaws, it is bound to lead us astray which may be what happened in the place crash. An air traffic controller shortage can lead to exhausted control towers too.
  The more we rely on technology, the less capable people become. Because of this, when technology makes a mistake, we can be too trusting and end up making a fatal mistake like what happened in the plane. To prevent this, we should not only continue to improve on our technology but also make sure that we can function without relying on it too much. Exhausted air traffic control towers can lead to pilots being allowed to make bad calls on their route. A few moments before the crash, a crewmember requested to fly closer to the other aircraft since they could see it, this request was approved and the two aircrafts crashed shortly afterward. This could've either been a bad idea or an unexpected accident. Regardless, bolstering the work force and improving our technology and capabilities might prevent this from happening.

Prompt: What's the most interesting thing you learned last week? It could be from this class, another subject, a conversation, a YouTube video, or even something you discovered on your own. Explain what it was, how you learned it, and why you found it interesting.
Response: The most interesting thing I learned last week was what a Freudian Slip was. A Freudian Slip occurs when you accidently say something that reveals your subconcious thoughts. I learned what it was after a song that used it in its title piqued my interest. I find it interesting because apparently these slip-ups can give insight as to what someone is really thinking or feeling.
# February 24, 2025
Prompt: Write two paragraphs exploring how technology could bridge generational language gaps while maintaining professionalism and cultural awareness.
Response: Technology can bridge generational gaps while maintaining professionalism and cultural awareness through social media by making everyone aware of new, appropriate words to use with their peers, elders, and juniors. Educators and service providers can view the same media platforms as the demographic they want to communicate with to learn new words and trends at the same time. There are probably a decent amount of videos on TikTok and YouTube that give explanations on the new generation's slang and trends. 
Moving on, integrating slang translation tools into educational apps, AI chatbots, or online resources can help different demographics understand the same information. I think the challenge associated with this would be the struggle to keep up with our evolving language. Although it can be helpful, I don't believe youth organizations should teach slang because it would compromise the overall professionalism of our workplaces. It is important for everyone to know the right time and place to say certain things. Misunderstandings of slang during youth and adult interactions can create hostility because neither side will be able to understand the other which leads to an inability to defuse the situation.
