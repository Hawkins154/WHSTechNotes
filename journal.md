Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Journal Prompt: In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language?
Response: I started learning Python on Code Combat a few days ago. Code Combat was a fun and interesting introduction to the language and now I know how to do "While True Loops". After finishing all the levels on Code Combat, I was introduced to EarSketch which will teach how to code using Python to create music. I haven't been able to explore EarSketch quite yet but I'm sure I'll be able to learn more. From my experience, the most challenging thing about Python is making sure I include all of my punctuation marks and format my code properly. The final level on Code Combat was challenging because I struggled with using conditional statements properly.

Journal Prompt: In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?
Response: It is important to follow instructions exactly how they are given when learning to code so that you don't add any extra code or get the wrong result. When I was writing code for an assignment in Project STEM, it took forever to finish and then it took even longer to debug. Following instructions and syntax when coding is important so that your code can actually run properly and you don't have to analyze each line of code to figure out what went wrong. Also, paying attention to how certain functions are structured can prevent you from having to try to code differently to fix the syntax error.

Journal Prompt: Think about your daily routine and activities. Identify one task or process where computer science plays a role, either directly or indirectly. Write a paragraph describing how computer science is used and how it impacts your life. Consider things like apps you use, websites you visit, or even the technology behind devices you rely on. How would your day be different without this use of computer science?
Response: Computer science is used in the chromebooks we use for school. Computer science helps chromebooks carry out different actions when you press a key on the keyboard or tap on a tab to switch to it. Computer science is used for security in district owned chromebooks by restricting searches based on what keywords were used or restricting sites that could steal personal information. If we didn't use chromebooks at school, many of our assignments would have to be done on paper which would put a burden on the environment and keep us from getting work done for different classes easily. If I didn't have a chromebook, I wouldn't have to worry about charging it or making sure I have enough space in my backpack to put it in.

Journal Prompt: Research a job or career path in the field of computer science that interests you. In your journal entry, write a paragraph or more addressing the following:

1. Job Title: What is the job or career path you researched?
2. Job Description: What are the main responsibilities or tasks for this role?
3. Skills Required: What programming languages, tools, or skills are important for this position?
4. Education and Experience: What level of education or experience is typically needed for this role?
5. Career Growth: What opportunities for growth or advancement are available in this career?
6. Reflection: How does this job align with your interests and goals in computer science?
Response:
1. Graphic Designer
2. Graphic designers create visuals for companies so they can use it for their advertisements. The things they develop are often placed on magazines, brochures, and reports.
3. Graphic designers need to know their way around advanced design software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator in order to create their images. Employers prefer to hire graphic designers who know language like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
4. To be a graphic designer, you need a bachelor's degree in graphic design or a related fine arts field. It might also be necessary to complete technical trainings.
5. Graphic designers can be promoted to higher positions like chief graphic designer, art director, and other supervision positions.
6. This job aligns with my interests because my brother is a graphic designer and I might be able to learn a lot from him if I want to do it too. It aligns with my goals because I just want to have a stable job that makes a satisfactory amount of money in the future.

Journal Prompt: Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:
How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
How might understanding code help you in industries that arenâ€™t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?
Response: Coding can be useful even if you have a job that doesn't require it. First, coding can help improve problem-solving skills by teaching you how to make programs that do the same thing in different ways and by forcing you to pay more attention to small details through debugging exercises. Understanding code can help in industries unrelated to technology by giving you the ability to simplify tedious processes using code or fix code that isn't working properly. Hospitals have to send bills to all of their patients and it's very time consuming to have someone work on billing for each patient. Hospitals use automated systems to send these bills automatically so they can spend more time and money on giving care. Coding can also enhance creativity and collaboration by making it easier for multiple people to work on the same thing and do it in different ways. It is possible to create programs that use different methods to achieve the same result and there are a lot of sites that allow multiple people to write code on the same document. This enhances creativity by allowing people to do things in their own way together.
